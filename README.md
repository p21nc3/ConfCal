## Google Apps Script Integration

This project includes a Google Apps Script that fetches top-rated conferences (A++, A*, A+, A) from the CFP JSON endpoint and updates the Google Sheet automatically.

### Setup Instructions

1. Open the Google Sheet at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Qt_tHtdUPTXQMDyoiHjDi8ELiOBF7mUv-BAF-lltbg/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
2. Go to **Extensions â†’ Apps Script**
3. Copy and paste the script from the file `apps_script/fetch_top_conferences.gs` in this repository
4. Save the script and run the `importTopCFPs()` function to test
5. Set up a trigger to run automatically:
   - Click on **Triggers** (clock icon) in the left sidebar
   - Click **Add Trigger**
   - Configure a time-driven trigger as needed (daily/weekly)

The script will fetch the latest conference data, filter for top-rated venues, and update the sheet automatically.
